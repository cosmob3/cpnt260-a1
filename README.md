- Github repo link: [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/cosmob3/cpnt260-a1)
- Github Pages Site: [Github Pages Site](https://cosmob3.github.io/cpnt260-a1/)

- It was hard knowing exactly what to change or edit because I couldn't see the changes having in real time, unlike Codepen. 
  - At first I tried to deal with it and just push everytime and wait until the website loaded. Then I realized that I had the "Go live" extension in VScode so I started using that. Eventually I put everything into Codepen for the last tweaks.
